💻 Maksym Zelinskyi – Aspiring Software Engineer

👋 Hi, I’m Maksym, a self-taught software developer and high school student (Première Générale – Euro Anglais section) based in Narbonne, France. Passionate about backend development and clean architecture, I’ve built real-world applications using Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and Docker — and I’m just getting started.

I’m currently looking for a software engineering internship (remote or in Occitanie), ideally where I can contribute to real projects, learn from experienced engineers, and grow into a world-class developer.
